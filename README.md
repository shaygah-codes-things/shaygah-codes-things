# Hi there, I'm @shaygah-codes-things 👋

👩🏻‍💻 Aspiring developer on a quest to unravel the mysteries of code - one bug at a time!

🔍 I'm currently involved with Ruby 💎, Angular 🅰️, and the styling magic of Tailwind CSS 🪄.

📚 You'll usually find me scrolling through documentation with a cup of coffee ☕ and a curated playlist blasting in the background 🎧.
